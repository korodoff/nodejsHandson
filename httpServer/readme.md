Node Js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser

Node.js is an open source server environment Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

Why Node.js?
Node.js uses asynchronous programming!

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system. Waits while the file system opens and reads the file. Returns the content to the client. Ready to handle the next request. Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system. Ready to handle the next request. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client. Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.

What Can Node.js Do?
Node.js can generate dynamic page content Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server Node.js can collect form data Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect Node.js files have extension ".js"

Initiate the Node.js File
The file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place.

Start your command line interface, write node myfirst.js and hit enter:

Initiate "myfirst.js":

C:\Users\Your Name>node myfirst.js Now, your computer works as a server!
